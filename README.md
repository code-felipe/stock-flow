# StockFlow API

StockFlow is a REST API for managing product catalogs and inventory.

It provides a structured backend service that supports product lifecycle management, search, and stock tracking — similar to the backend needs of small to mid-size e-commerce systems.

## Core Features

- Product management (CRUD): [Product CRUD module details](docs/product-crud-module.md)
- Inventory management (CRUD): [Inventory CRUD module details](docs/inventory-crud-module.md)
- Order management (CRUD): [Order CRUD module details](docs/order-crud-module.md)
- Inventory tracking per product
- Soft deletion to preserve historical data
- Pagination and sorting for large datasets
- Dynamic product filtering (price, stock, name, SKU, category, ranges): [Product Filter module details](docs/product-filter-module.md)
- Dynamic store/inventory filtering (price, stock, name, SKU, category, onHand, reserved, ranges): [Inventory Filter module details](docs/inventory-filter-module.md)
- RESTful API design with clear resource modeling
- Input validation and centralized exception handling
- Architecture - Package by Feature - [Architecture details](docs/architecture.md)

## UML - Domain Model

The domain model is designed to reflect a realistic catalog/inventory structure and maintain separation between persistence and API layers.

## Database Schema - Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The following diagram represents the current database schema generated 
from the live MySQL instance. It reflects the implemented entities and 
their relationships as of the current development phase.
> Note: The schema reflects the current implementation phase. 
> Some modules such as CartItem (session-based) are not represented 
> as they do not persist in the database.

## Modules

Each module groups one or more related entities under a shared business concern. Below is a brief description of each, with a link to its detailed documentation.

| Module | Entities | Description | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Admin — Stock Management** | `Store` · `Product` · `Inventory` | Gives the admin full control over what products exist, which store holds them, and how much stock is available. Intentionally isolated from the customer-facing layer. | [View](docs/store-inventory-product-category-module.md) |
| **Catalog** | `Category` | Manages how products are classified and grouped for browsing.|

> Module docs follow the same format: overview, responsibilities, API endpoints, and design decisions.

## Purpose

StockFlow is a learning-driven but realistically designed backend service that explores:

- REST API design
- Data modeling with JPA
- Filtering and pagination strategies
- Validation and error handling patterns
- Separation of concerns in layered architecture

The goal is to simulate how a real catalog/inventory backend might be structured while keeping the project maintainable and extensible.
