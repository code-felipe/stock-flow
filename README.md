# StockFlow API

StockFlow is a REST API for managing product catalogs and inventory.

It provides a structured backend service that supports product lifecycle management, search, and stock tracking — similar to the backend needs of small to mid-size e-commerce systems.

---

## Core Features

- Product management (CRUD): [Product CRUD module details](docs/product-crud-module.md)
- Inventory tracking per product
- Soft deletion to preserve historical data
- Pagination and sorting for large datasets
- Dynamic product filtering (price, stock, name, SKU): [Product Filter module details](docs/product-filter-module.md)
- RESTful API design with clear resource modeling
- Input validation and centralized exception handling
- Architecture - Package by Feature - [Architecture details](docs/architecture.md)

## UML - Domain Model

The domain model is designed to reflect a realistic catalog/inventory structure and maintain separation between persistence and API layers.

## Modules

Each module groups one or more related entities under a shared business concern. Below is a brief description of each, with a link to its detailed documentation.

| Module | Entities | Description | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Admin — Stock Management** | `Store` · `Product` · `Inventory` | Gives the admin full control over what products exist, which store holds them, and how much stock is available. Intentionally isolated from the customer-facing layer. | [View →](docs/store-inventory-product-category-module.md) |
| **Catalog** | `Category` | Manages how products are classified and grouped for browsing.|

> Module docs follow the same format: overview, responsibilities, API endpoints, and design decisions.

## Purpose

StockFlow is a learning-driven but realistically designed backend service that explores:

- REST API design
- Data modeling with JPA
- Filtering and pagination strategies
- Validation and error handling patterns
- Separation of concerns in layered architecture

The goal is to simulate how a real catalog/inventory backend might be structured while keeping the project maintainable and extensible.
